Create a 2 VMs and a shell script called prepare_servers. The script when run 
updates the system, removes openssh (if installed), installs openssh, copies the 
public keys, then ssh the other system. Once run the script should end with a ssh 
prompt to the other system. Use variables to define the host and user names


#!/bin/bash

# Define the host names and user names
HOST1="vm1"
HOST2="vm2"
USER="bard"

# Update the system
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade

# Remove openssh if installed
if [ -x "$(command -v openssh)" ]; then
  sudo apt remove openssh-server openssh-client
fi

# Install openssh
sudo apt install openssh-server openssh-client

# Copy the public keys
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub $USER@$HOST1
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub $USER@$HOST2

# SSH to the other system
ssh $USER@$HOST2
